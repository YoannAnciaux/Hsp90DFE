# What : - Filters data to keep only common genotypes across treatments
#        - Transforms fitnesses in selection coefficients (s)
#        - Summarises : - mean of s over replicates per EnvironmentXPositionXAA
#                       - approximated standard deviation of the measurement error over the replicate per EnvironmentXPositionXAA
#        - Saves summarized data in a format for lazy loading.
