# A brief overview

* April 8, 2021 cloned Yoann repo and and adding a Readme.md (this file :)) 

We document here the analysis of the HSP90 mutants data. 
We fit a so called Fgm model to the data
We use simpe simulations under the fitted FGM model to obtain distribution of summary stats matching the ones computed from the ranking and variance of fitness of mutants across environments
